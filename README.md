## Description

The "Pinterest Data Pipeline" project aims to create a data pipeline system similar to the one used by Pinterest on the AWS Cloud platform.

- Ingest, process, and analyse data from various sources.
- Gain insights into AWS services like Amazon EC2, IAM and S3.
- Implement data transformation, storage, and analysis workflows.
- Learn best practices for data pipeline architecture and management.
